# SubredditImporter
Command line tool to import/export subreddits from one account to another

Mostly lifted from a post by Reddit User Hammond of Texas and bundled for easy use - https://www.reddit.com/user/Hammond-of-Texas/.

You can either build from source or use the exe directly at \bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\win-x64\publish\RedditImporter.exe
